The KPN Missions is the Mission arm of the Kadosh Prayer Network. The bible says go into all the world to preach the good news to all nations. Consequently, many men are women are in places far from their comfort zone with a goal to accomplish Gods mandate. Our mandate as KPN missions is therefore to make provisions (first in prayers , then financial and any other way) to ensure that the gospel of Jesus is spread to all men. Whilst we do this, we know that there are many others who desire to share what they have with missionaries out there. This app is to give such opportunities so that we can together share the gospel to the ends of earth even as we await the coming our Lord.
